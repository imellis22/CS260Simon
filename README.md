This deliverable demonstrates authenticating users and storing credentials and authentication tokens in MongoDB.   

Seeing the way the front end was able to communicate with the server and in turn the back end to not only create but also authenticate users was really cool. It was cool to see how the code was prepared to respond to any response from the server, either 200 or anything else. I also thought the way the back end encrypts the password to store in the database was cool because it allows the database to be breach and still have user's data relatively safe, at least to a point.
