The tag in meta data in about.html is new. I never realized you could use viewpoint to adjust how the images showed up relative to the size of the page. 

For the index.html, it asks for a login to play. But what database is it going to reference to actually verify someone?

It is impressive that we are able to make the entire Simon wheel using only HTML. There is a lot more capability to HTML than I realized, it just never gets used because of CSS and JavaScript.
