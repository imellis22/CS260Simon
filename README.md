The tag in meta data in about.html is new. I never realized you could use viewpoint to adjust how the images showed up relative to the size of the page.

This excersise really opened my eyes to the potential of HTML, even though it doesn't every get used. I was able to replicate somethings that could actually pass for a really low level website with a few graphics and things. I didn't really think that possible with HTML.
