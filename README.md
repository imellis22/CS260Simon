This deliverable demonstrates converting the JavaScript application into a web application by implementing a web service that listens on a network port for HTTP requests.

This was really cool to use and implement. The idea that you can store data on your server is really useful to help make it a bit more persistant, even though every time you stop your server the data will be wiped. 
Its nice that the express package has so much functionality built into it. It makes sending requests and using node.js significantly easier. 

I really figured out how to use the .env file to use enviromental variables to call the database. This will be super helpful when trying to hook up a database for my startup project. It also helped me understand even more the function and necessity of the .gitignore file to help protect important infomation such as the log in information to access my database.
